# Multi-dimensional-Resource-Management-for-Advanced-HTS-Systems
To maximize the utilization of satellite resources and fully optimize as many flexible payloads as possible, this work implements an optimization method for jointly optimizing the frequency band, beam, and power multi-dimensional resources, where the flexibility of the beam includes state, position, and width.
